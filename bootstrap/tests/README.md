Tests for the Atomish Bootstrapper
==================================

This directory contains tests for the Atomish Bootstrapper. The entry point for the tests is `tests.sh`, which shells out to other shell scripts to perform each of the sets of tests. There is no test harness yet, and test failures are printed to stdout and indicated by a non-zero return code.

At the moment there is only a simple regression test here.
