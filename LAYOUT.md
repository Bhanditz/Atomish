The bootstrap interpreter is written in Scala, and interprets a pre-atomish language which is powerful enough to write the actual atomish interpreter and compiler in, but significantly simpler than the full atomish language. It is located in the bootstrap subdirectory.

Tests are always in the test subdirectory of the directory being tested.
